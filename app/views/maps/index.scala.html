        <p>Credit unions are not-for-profit institutions where the owners are you, the member, not shareholders or private interests.</p>
        <p>Credit unions offer similar services as commercial banks. You can open savings/checking accounts, retirement, and lending
        products that are affordable with flexible terms and guidelines.</p>
        <p>Benefits to membership include zero or low monthly minimum account balances, an opportunity to build or rebuild credit, and
        high member satisfaction. Backed by the NCUA, credit unions offer the same security as large commercial banks.</p>
        <p>Now that you know about credit unions, let's talk about how you join one. It can be very difficult to identify a credit union
        you are eligible to join because of the variety of membership requirements. There's no single resource where the rules are laid
        out efficiently right now. That's why we started Credit Union Findr -- a simple way for you to find a credit union you can join
        offering the services that you need. Much like a dating service, Credit Union Findr utilizes your data to match you with credit
        unions you are eligible to join.</p>
